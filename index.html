    RECIPES PORTRAYING THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF LIFE, GET READY TO PUT THE BURNT FOOD IN YOUR MOUTH

  <!-- <div class="box">
    <p class="box1">A website created to show failure and success of my cooking. As a student we go through many ups and downs. I want to portray this through my cooking that even though you may fail sometimes as I do in my cooking and sometimes even after trying a lot you still might not see any progressd but does that mean you should give up? Not at all since perfection comes from hardword and nothing can be done without it. </p>

    <p class="box1">This website is a showcase of all my hardwork and practice. I cook and cook and sometimes i fail but i eventually lead on to making tasteful and presentable food items which show how even though I am falling iun the start I eventually rise up. This website is the key for all those people who might be feeling low, who might be thinking things are not working out for them but this is a reminder that everything eventually comes in place.  </p>

<section class="timeline">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>PASTA</time> A bit undercooked and a liitle too salted. Not a great start but as you do something new nothing is easy in the start you work through and this is just the beginning.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>FRIED RICE</time> Rice was undercooked and again too much salt but tried something new and learned something new and is'nt that what life is all about trying, falling and getting up to try again. 
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time> KADHI CHAWAL</time> My relationship with salt is one tough to explain since it overpowered again. In life certain things hold you back but break free from the cluctes to do your best.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time> CHICKEN SALAD</time> With fresh ingredients a fresh start happens and som ething when you start fresh iot can be overwhelming just like my salad dressing but atleast it is a fresh start.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>BAGEL</time> As you think life is knocking you down you get back up just like my expectations did when I made this bagel. It might seem easy but to get the perfect amount of sauces was a success for me.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>INDIAN FOOD</time> Sometimes you need to get out of our comfort zone to see your capabilities just like I did when I cooked this entire Indian meal from scartc and the result was good so Life may surprise you and you never know it's coming.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>INDIAN KHICHDI</time> The khichdi was cooked perfectly. The rice was soft and the lentil was chewy and the salt was perfect so I assume the struggle is over and life is finally rewarding me.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>ADVANCE BAGEL</time> Tried to make a recipe of mine better by adding and experimenting with more ingredients. Some worked while some did'nt but know I have reached that stage that I am tryng to better my work than just learn it.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>TOMATO RICE</time> A not so success recipe made completely from scartch. It got burned a little but I learned that overconfidence is a sin and life pulls you back down when thatb happens.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>CHOLE NAAN</time> Nover loose hope since a complicated Indian recipe called chole was cooked perfectly from scratch by me. Life might be a little tough but never fade away from a challange since success is always waiting for you.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
